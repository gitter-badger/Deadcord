## ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporarily closed source.
After a large amount of thought, for the best of Deadcord, our team has decided to make Deadcord closed source for a temporary amount of time.
We made this decision for two reasons:

* There is evidence that Discord is patching key components of Deadcord.
* Our goal is to make better change in Discord, not having our work re-distributed.

Updates and bug-fixes will continue as normal, this repo will be used for open-sourced 
Deadcord snippets and releases. **If you have any questions, join our community Discord.**

## üö® Disclaimer
I do not endorse nor condone raids. Any actions carried out by our tool are at your own risk. We are responsible for creating our tool, but not for how it is used.
To protect our work, and to prevent it from being re-distributed, we have not provided detailed development setup instructions.

## ‚ùì Why was Deadcord made?
Many people may question why we built Deadcord, let alone made it open-source. Deadcord was built to protest against several of Discords recent actions and decisions, among other things. We built Deadcord to protest against:

* The forced shutdown of `discord.py`.
* Switching every bot over to slash commands.
* Discord and YouTube partnership, forcing music bots to shutdown.
* Not accepting feedback from the community.
* Locks a lot of new features behind paywalls or restricts them.
* Not focusing on the user experience.
* Against BetterDiscord.
* Hides behind their TOS to avoid lengthy user questions.
* **Discord hypocrisy, introducing alt account system, when they want to prevent spam and raids.**

## üöÄ Lets see the features
* Spam speed increases with each token you add.
* Deadcord averages about 300 pings every 4-5 seconds with 20-30 tokens.
* Bots can bypass simple verification.
* Different spam modes: Regular, @everyone, mass user ping, giant blank messages, and laggy messages. 
* Bots join and leave servers with a short random delay. 
* Advanced token ping to purge dead or invalid tokens.
* Change all bots nickname and status at once.
* Deadcord engine behaves like the Discord client.
* Injects directly into Discord, and uses custom UI elements using BetterDiscord.
* One click and disguise bots. (Change profile picture and server nickname).
* Change all the bots profile pictures.
* Built in safety trigger to prevent your tokens from being locked.
* More features are on the way.

## üèÅ Setup for Development

I will not be providing in-depth setup instructions. Part of this is to protect my work, as well as the statement declared in the *dsclaimer* section. If you wish to use our tool, download a release from our `releases` section.

## üß∞ Basic Usage

Download the latest release from our `releases` section. Download the file to a location of your choosing.

1. Open Deadcord by double-clicking on the executable file. A terminal window should popup.

2. Create a file named `tokens.txt` with your tokens, located in the same directory as Deadcord.
   
   **Your token file should follow this format:**
    * No quotation marks.
    * Each token is on its own line.

   **!! Make sure your tokens file does not look like this: `tokens.txt.txt` !!**
    
3. Install our BetterDiscord plugin provided in our Discord Server.

4. Make sure Deadcord is running in the background.

4. If the steps above finish successfully, you are good to go!

## ‚ùì FAQ's

#### Is this a Discord bot?
No, Deadcord is not a Discord **Bot**, it is a program to automate user accounts with their corresponding token.

#### Can my tokens get phone-locked?
We have successfully tested Deadcord against several scenarios. You are able to spam constantly for 5 hours before your tokens are locked. if you use our tool wisely, they should never get phone-locked.

#### How can I protect my server?
If you want a quick way to protect your server, I would recommend using a server captcha bot. They are easy to setup, but they will not prevent Deadcord bots from bypassing them in recent updates.

#### Can I use bot tokens?
No, Deadcord is not compatiable with Discord bot tokens.
